Instead of going from 10% to 50% brightness intensity if the sound volume goes from 10% to 50%, it goes to 10% + {smoothingValue}.\r\n- The color changes according to the color of your screen:\r\n\t- COLOR_AVG (default): takes the average of the colors of your screen (in the center)\r\n\t- NONE: the color won't change\r\n- You can configure everything by hand, or you can use the default config\r\n- You can run the program with a command line that contains all the information needed to connect to the device and to set the configuration\r\n\r\n**Device detection**\r\n- You can scan for compatible devices, then you have to select the one that you want\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n- You can still use your gaming controller while using the program, it won't interact with it\r\n- It works with full screen apps\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer**\r\n- If the color variable is not set to NONE, you may get banned by intrusive anti-cheats (like Riot Vanguard). I did not test it though. The program acts like it's taking screenshots. Works great for Survival Games. Rocket League is safe as well. If you get banned, don't blame me!",
